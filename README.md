# TODO

## Demo

- [ ] Integration with Gnosis?

## Bugs

- [x] Cannot paste in the debugger
- [ ] When the same thing appears more than once
- [x] Escaping regex and unescaping
- [x] This is too greedy and kills the browser `(\n(?:\s.*\n)*\s*)` (Preview is unstable)
- [x] Preview mode does not work exactly like regex 101
- [ ] Need to validate debugger input to comply with state shape or the thing crashes

## Features

- [x] Preview mode
- [x] Editing final regex and show preview
